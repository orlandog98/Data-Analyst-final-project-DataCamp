It was obtained 1500 different values, so the criteria was in order. In addition to see if there was not null values, it was needed to use the isnull function and sum, if the value is 0, then it means that there are not null values. \n![2. 1.a.productid  ](2.%201.a.productid%20%20.png)\nFor category, it was needed to check null values, again using the procedure than before it said that there was not null values, in addition it was used a code `for val in df_pet_category:\n    if (val != 'Housing') and (val != 'Food') and (val != 'Toys') and (val != 'Equipment') and (val != 'Medicine')  and (val != 'Accessory') and (val != 'Unknown'): \n        print(val)` to see if in the list the only categories were the mentioned before and also the missing values were replaced by unknown, however in this case the missing values were replaced by \"-\".\n![3. 1.a.categories](3.%201.a.categories.png)\nFor animal to check null values was used the function mentioned before, and for check the type of animals was used the next code `c=0\nfor val in df_pet_animal:\n    if (val != 'Dog') and (val != 'Cat') and (val != 'Fish') and (val != 'Bird') and (val != 'Unknown'): \n        c=c+1\n        print(val)\nprint(c)` To count the values in the list that are not Dog, Cat, etc or Unknown. \n![4. 1.a.animal](4.%201.a.animal.png)\nTo count null size it was used the funciton mentioned before of not null, and to see if the size only have the three values of Small, Medium and Large it was used the next code: `c=0\nwrong_values=[]\nfor val in df_pet_size:\n    if (val != 'Small') and (val != 'Medium') and (val != 'Large') and (val != 'Unknown'): \n        c=c+1\n        wrong_values.append(val)\nprint(c)\nprint(wrong_values)` To see how many values are different that the mentioned before and see why are those values different. \n![5. 1.a.size](5.%201.a.size.png)\nFor price it was realized that the data was string, so it was easier to use regular expression to see if the numbers inserted are posivite, also to check that there are two numbers after decimal point. `import re\nc=0\nwrong_values=[]\nfor val in df_pet_price:\n    n= re.match(\"^\\d+\\.\\d\\d$\", val)\n    if not n:\n        c=c+1\n        wrong_values.append(val)\nprint(c)\nprint (wrong_values)\n`\n![6. 1.a.price](6.%201.a.price.png)\nFor sales the same method was applied, nevertheless the values were float, so at the beginning it was transformed the values to string and then applied the regular expression. \n`import re\nc=0\nwrong_values=[]\nfor val in df_pet_sales:\n    val=str(val)\n    n= re.match(\"^\\d+\\.\\d\\d$\", val)\n    if not n:\n        c=c+1\n        wrong_values.append(val)\nprint(c)\nprint (wrong_values)`\n![7. 1.a.sales](7.%201.a.sales.png)\nFor rating it was used if conditions to check if the number was bigger than 10 and less or equal than 1, and count the values that are beyond those limits. \n`c=0\nwrong_values=[]\nfor val in df_pet_rating:\n    if (val >10) or (val < 0):\n        c=c+1\n        wrong_values.append(val)\nprint(c)\nprint (wrong_values)`\n![8. 1.a.rating](8.%201.a.rating.png)\nFinally, for repeat_purchase it was used an if condition to see if the value is different to 0 and different to 1, the data with those requirements will be counted and if is bigger than 0 it means there will be wrong values added. \n`c=0\nwrong_values=[]\nfor val in df_pet_repeat_purchase:\n    if (val !=0) and (val != 1):\n        c=c+1\n        wrong_values.append(val)\nprint(c)\nprint (wrong_values)`\n![9 1.a.repeat](9%201.a.repeat.png)\n\nTo check the missing values in all the columns was simple, in most of the cases were used the function `.isnull().sum()`\nAs we can see in product id, animal, size, sales, rating and purchase.\nHowever in category it was used the code:\n`df_pet_category.value_counts()['-']` because the missing values were replaced by \"-\".\nThe same happened with price, because the missing values were replaced by 'unlisted' \n`df_pet_price.value_counts()['unlisted']`\nIt was obtained: \n0 missing values in product_id\n25 missing values in category\n0 missing values in animal\n0 missing values in size\n150 missing values in price\n0 missing values in sales\n150 missing values in rating\n0 missing values in repeat purchase\n![10 1.b.1](10%201.b.1.png)\n![11. 1.b.2](11.%201.b.2.png)\n\n*For step a and b it was easier to me to use a dataframe for each category (does not affect the result). In step c it was used the real dataframe imported for excel. \n\nFinally to replace and match the values for each category it was needed to use the replace function of dataframes.\n\nProduct id was not needed to be replaced.\n\nIn category it was used the replace function to replace the '-' to unknown.\n`df_pet['category'] = df_pet['category'].replace(['-'], 'Unknown')\ndf_pet['category'].value_counts()['Unknown']`\n\nAnimal was not needed to be replaced\n\nFor size, it was noted that the size had different lower and upper letters, so the easiest way was to change all the data to lower letters and then replace the lower letter words to Large, Medium and Small. \n`df_pet['size']= df_pet['size'].str.lower()\ndf_pet['size']=df_pet['size'].replace(['large','medium','small'],['Large','Medium','Small'])\ndf_pet['size'].head()`\n\nFor price the first thing was to replace the 'unlisted' with 0, then change the values from string to float, then obtain the median of all the values and finally replace the 0 values to the median obtained before. At the end all the values were rounded by 2. \n`df_pet['price']=df_pet['price'].replace('unlisted',0)\ndf_pet['price']=df_pet['price'].astype(float)\nmedian=df_pet['price'].median()\ndf_pet['price']=df_pet['price'].replace(0,median)\ndf_pet['price'].round(2)`\n\nFor sales, all the values were rounded by 2. \n`df_pet['sales'].round(2)`\n\nFor rating it was used the function fillna to replace the null values to 0. \n`df_pet['rating'].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)\ndf_pet['rating'].isnull().sum()`\n\nRepeat purchases was not needed to be replaced\n![12. 1.ca](12.%201.ca.png)\n![13. 1.c.2](13.%201.c.2.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"332952ef-8bc4-4555-be30-b40f0fd9933c"},{"source":"## Task 2","metadata":{},"id":"643d4c36-4183-4fbe-a263-6b9de60d29da","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"_Write your answer here_\n\nTo visualize how many products are repeat purchases for each category it was necessary first to group the data for each category, and then sum all the repeat purchases values to obtain the category with most repeated purchases values.\n\n`import matplotlib as mp\ndf_pet.groupby('category')['repeat_purchase'].sum().plot(kind='bar')\nmp.pyplot.show()`\n![14. 2](14.%202.png)\n\nIt was obtained the next bar chart \n![foo](foo.png)\nAs we can see from the bar chart, the equipment is the category that has the most repeated values, with 221.

It is clear that there are some outliers in the graph. In addition, the graph is slightly skewed to the left, therefore the mean is less than the median (value= 1000.83)\n\nThe next graph shows a pyplot, that help us with the idea that the data has some outliers. Also we can see in a better way the value of the median and the value of the 1st quartile (747.42) and the 3rd quartile (1158.16)\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"8fcff247-db49-42c0-8710-51848aeb6347","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 4","metadata":{},"id":"c5fbe3a0-d277-437c-a1a0-f1edf80684f7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"_Write your answer here_\n\nFinally to see the relationship between repeat purchases and sales it was needed an ANOVA, because is the relation between a categorical variable and a continous variable.\n![16. 4](16.%204.png)\n\nObtaining a p value of 0.00207, because it is very small, we can reject the null hyphotesis and said that there is a correlation between the purchases and sales.
